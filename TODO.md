## 🟢 Critical Bugs (from ROADMAP)

- [x] **CD2** Exclude `token` from `Configuration.to_dict()` — `underwrite/__config__.py:265-284` (also excludes `encryption_passphrase`)
- [x] **CD4/HD6** Fix path traversal in `FileStore.__path` — `underwrite/__store__.py:343-362` (verified, resolved)
- [x] **HD3** Bound `FraudService.__records` with `deque(maxlen=100000)` — `underwrite/services/fraud/service.py:28,93,115` (bounded defaults fixed)
- [x] **CD5** Add `FileStore` thread cleanup in `ServiceSupervisor.shutdown()` — `underwrite/__supervisor__.py:81-84`, `underwrite/__runtime__.py:581`
- [x] **HD8** Add `PrometheusMiddleware` import-failure warning — `underwrite/__serve__.py:56-64` (verified, resolved)
- [x] **MD5** Fix env var type coercion in `Configuration.__apply_env_overrides` — `underwrite/__config__.py:403-459` (verified, resolved)

## 🔴 High Impact — New Features

### Bus Backends (v1.0.0 must-have)

- [x] **SQS Event Bus Backend** — `SqsBus(EventBus)` for distributed deployment via Amazon SQS (# importlib lazy import of boto3)
  - File: `underwrite/__bus_sqs__.py` (162 lines)
- [x] **Modal Event Bus Backend** — `ModalBus(EventBus)` for Modal.com serverless queues (# importlib lazy import of modal)
  - File: `underwrite/__bus_modal__.py` (138 lines)

### Infrastructure (v1.0.0 must-have)

- [ ] **Saga Persistence** — Store-backed saga log (currently in-memory only, all sagas lost on restart)
  - References: `__saga__.py`, `docs/ADR/004-saga-orchestration.md:80`, `docs/ROADMAP.md:23`
- [ ] **DLQ Persistence + Replay Automation** — Persist dead-letter queue items, CLI for replay
  - References: `__bus__.py`, `docs/ROADMAP.md:41`
- [ ] **Distributed Rate Limiting** — `DistributedRateLimiter` with Redis/Store backend (currently per-process)
  - References: `docs/ROADMAP.md:40`

### Services

- [x] **Real Recovery Service** — Now implements multi-stage recovery (negotiation → payment plan → escalation → settlement) with in-memory state tracking per borrower
  - References: `underwrite/services/recovery/service.py` (152 lines)
  - Implements: negotiation workflows, payment plans, escalation, recovery rate computation

### Observability (v1.0.0 must-have)

- [ ] **Prometheus `/metrics` at Standard Path** — Currently at `/v1/metrics`, not the standard Prometheus path
  - References: `docs/ROADMAP.md:22`
- [ ] **Structured Logging with Correlation IDs** — Proper middleware-based correlation ID propagation
  - References: `__runtime__.py:186` (currently `type: ignore[attr-defined]`), `docs/ROADMAP.md:65`
- [ ] **FastAPI OTLP Auto-Instrumentation** — `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi` integration
  - References: `docs/ROADMAP.md:39`

---

## 🟡 Medium Impact — Features & Improvements

### New Functionality

- [ ] **Config-Driven Fee Schedules** — Replace `FEE_SCHEDULES` hardcoded dict with configurable rules
  - References: `docs/ROADMAP.md:28`
- [ ] **Plugin-Based Risk Model Loading** — Dynamic loading of `RiskScoringStrategy` implementations from external packages
  - References: `docs/ROADMAP.md:37`, `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md:200`
- [ ] **Event Payload Schema Versioning** — No mechanism for coexisting v1/v2 of the same event type
  - References: `docs/ADR/002-event-driven-communication.md:49`, `__schema__.py`
- [ ] **Async Event Bus** — `AsyncLocalBus` exists but not integrated as a first-class backend option
  - References: `__async_bus__.py`, `docs/ROADMAP.md:27`
- [x] **`EnvSecretsBackend.set()` Implementation** — Now writes to `os.environ` at runtime
  - References: `underwrite/__secrets__.py:34-37`

### Missing Tests (High Risk)

- [ ] **`__plugins__.py` Test Coverage** — 52-line module doing dynamic import loading via `importlib.metadata.entry_points` — zero tests
  - File: `underwrite/__plugins__.py`
- [ ] **`__service_registry__.py` Test Coverage** — 140-line module with all 28 service mappings and event wiring — zero tests. Wiring errors = silent event drops at runtime
  - File: `underwrite/__service_registry__.py`
- [ ] **`DelegationGraph` Direct Unit Tests** — 273-line graph engine (`graph.py`) tested only indirectly through `MechanismService`
  - File: `underwrite/services/mechanism/graph.py`
- [x] **`TestMechanismConcurrency` Concurrency Tests** — 3 stress tests replaced the skipped placeholder: concurrent user addition, mixed operations, and read-only quotes
  - File: `tests/test_concurrency_faults.py`

### Code Quality

- [x] **`BatchPersistenceMixin` Concrete Implementation** — Removed dead abstraction (no service ever used the mixin)
  - References: `underwrite/services/base.py:44` (removed)
- [ ] **`StoreRepository.serialize/deserialize` Real Implementations** — Currently passthrough methods meant to be overridden
  - References: `underwrite/services/persistence.py:83-89`
- [ ] **`postgres_dsn` Session-Scoped Skip Bug** — Missing `testcontainers` skips the entire test session (should be `pytest.importorskip`)
  - File: `tests/conftest.py:44-55`

## 🟢 Lower Impact — Polish & Tooling

### CI / Infrastructure

- [ ] **PyPI Publishing CI** — GitHub Actions release workflow for PyPI
  - References: `docs/ROADMAP.md:43`
- [ ] **Mutation Testing Integration** — `mutmut` declared + configured in `pyproject.toml` but never invoked in CI or Makefile
  - References: `pyproject.toml:65-67`, `[tool.mutmut]` section
- [ ] **`FileStore.keys()` Pagination** — No pagination for listing keys in large datasets
  - References: `docs/ROADMAP.md:32`
- [ ] **`docker-compose.yml` with Postgres + Vault + OTLP** — Currently single-service only
  - References: `docs/ROADMAP.md:71`

### Dependencies

- [x] **`twilio` Missing from `pyproject.toml`** — Added `notify` extra with `twilio>=8.0`; added import-failure guard in notification service
  - File: `pyproject.toml:72`, `underwrite/services/notification/service.py:117-121`

### Redundancy / Cleanup

- [ ] **`tests/test_new_services.py` Duplicates Coverage** — Smoke tests duplicate coverage already present in 6 dedicated service test files
- [ ] **`tests/test_new_features.py` Missing Assertions** — Several tests rely on "no exception raised" rather than asserting outcomes
