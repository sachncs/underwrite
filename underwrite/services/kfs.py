Generates Key Fact Statements per RBI Master Direction on KFS
(RBI/2023-24/86, Master Direction DNBR. PD. 008/03.10.119/2023-24).

A KFS includes:

  - Tenure
  - EMI amount with total interest payable
  - Total repayment amount
  - List of all fees and charges
  - Late payment / penal interest terms
